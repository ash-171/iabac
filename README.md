# INX Future Inc Employee Performance - Project

## Overview
INX Future Inc, (referred to as INX), is a leading data analytics and automation solutions provider with over 15 years of global business presence. INX is consistently rated as a top 20 best employer over the past 5 years. INX's human resource policies are considered employee-friendly and widely perceived as best practices in the industry.

However, recent years have seen a decline in employee performance indexes, raising concerns among top management. Service delivery escalations have increased, and client satisfaction levels have dropped by 8 percentage points.

To address these issues, CEO Mr. Brain has initiated a data science project to analyze current employee data and identify the core underlying causes of performance issues. The project aims to provide insights and recommendations to improve employee performance, without adversely affecting morale or the company's reputation as a top employer.

## Insights Expected
1. Department-wise performances
2. Top 3 Important Factors affecting employee performance
3. A trained model to predict employee performance based on input factors, for use in hiring
4. Recommendations to improve employee performance based on analysis insights
